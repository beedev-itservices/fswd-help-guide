HTML:
    1.  tags that don't need ending/closing tags
        1. <!DOCTYPE html>
        2. <br>
        3. <img src="">

CSS:
    1. when using mixins be sure there is no space between name and ()
        1. example: .flexrow();
    2. mixins:
        1. set of styles that are used often. Set up so that you just enter the mixin name and it will pull all the styling when compiled
        2. used in .less documents
        3. example = .flexrow {display: flex;
                            justify-content: center;
                            align-items: center;
                            flex-direction: row;}

                    When used later in the .less document it will look like this = .style {.flexrow();}
    3. variables:
        1. a single line of styling that is used with in a class style
        2. example = @border: 4px groove @brown;

                    when used laster in the .less document it will look like this = .style {}

Github and git flow:
    1. after forking repository copy clone link to download to local drive
    2. ctrl + v doesn't always work on some systems within the terminal you might need to use ctrl + shift + v to paste.
    3. Git commands in terminal:
        1. git clone <file address> = this allows you to clone to local drive
        2. cd <folder name> = takes you to the specified folder
        3. ls = lists the items in the folder you are after
        4. cd .. = takes you up one folder
        5. cd ~ = takes you to the base or main starting folder
        6. touch <file name> = adds said file to the folder your are in
        7. rm <file name> = removes said file but wil not ask if you are sure
        8. mkdir <folder name> = makes a folder in the current folder location
        9. rmdir <folder name> = will remove a folder with out asking but only if said folder is empty
        10. git checkout -b <name>  = adds a branch to the repository
        11. git checkout <file name> = removes a deleted item from the commit log
        12. git add <file name> = adds a file to be logged or added togithub
        13. git commit -m "<make comments>" = places a saved commit log for all files added and leaves a comments
        14. git push origin <branch name> = pushes the local files to github into the branch listed.  Use master for main branch or just git push for no branches made other wise use branch name
        15. git status = gives you a list of items that have been changed since the last commit with in the git dir
        16. code <file name> = will open the said file in local IDE

File extentions:
    1. name.html = a web page file
    2. name.css = css file will be linked in the html file in the head tag
    3. name.less = another form of css but has nesting and other components is easier to write and compiles the .css for you if set up right
    4. name.js = Java Script file will be linked to the html file at the end of the body
